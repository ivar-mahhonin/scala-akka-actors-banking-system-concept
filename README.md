# scala-akka-actors-banking-system-concept

This project written in Scala is POC for Akka Actors.

The idea is following. 

Let's say, we have a bank with clerks.

Visitors are approaching the bank to check their balances.

Depending on the number of clerks, there is a certain amount of visitors that the bank can process in parallel.
